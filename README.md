# Andiara's profile
## Welcome!

😄 I'm 25 years old, from Campinas/SP - Brazil! 
⚡ I enjoy learning about programming, gaming and studying new languages in my spare time. 

🖥️ I’m currently learning about web development
🖥️ Learning to program Markdown
🖥️ I have a basic knowledge on C and Python
🖥️ I'm also getting started on RAD this semester

   There's a fun fact about me: I work as a interior designer since 2022 and my goal is to get into the IT department of the big industries related to personalized furniture.
